# 🎉 Release Suite

Semantic versioning tools for Git-based projects, providing automated version computation, changelog generation and release notes creation.

## 🚀 Features

- Automatic version bump based on commit messages
- Conventional commit parsing (custom prefixes supported)
- Auto-generated `CHANGELOG.md`
- Auto-generated `RELEASE_NOTES.md` using GitHub CLI (gh)
- Local preview mode (`CHANGELOG.preview.md`, `RELEASE_NOTES.preview.md`)
- CI/CD ready for GitHub Actions
- No commit rules enforced on the main project
- Trusted Publishing (OIDC) — no npm tokens required

## ⚙️ Installation

```bash
npm install release-suite --save-dev
```

## 🖥️ CLI Commands

| Command                     | Description                                               |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `rs-compute-version`        | Computes next semantic version based on git commits       |
| `rs-generate-changelog`     | Generates `CHANGELOG.md`                                  |
| `rs-generate-release-notes` | Generates `RELEASE_NOTES.md` using GitHub PRs             |
| `rs-preview`                | Generates preview changelog & release notes               |
| `rs-create-tag`             | Create and push a git tag based on `package.json` version |

> 💡 **Note about execution**
>
> - When using these commands via `npm run`, they can be referenced directly (`rs-*`).
> - In CI/CD environments (e.g. GitHub Actions), always invoke them using `npx`
>   (e.g. `npx rs-generate-changelog`) to ensure proper binary resolution.

## 🧠 Usage

Add to your project's `package.json`:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "version:compute": "rs-compute-version",
    "changelog": "rs-generate-changelog",
    "release:notes": "rs-generate-release-notes",
    "preview": "rs-preview create",
    "preview:clear": "rs-preview remove",
    "create-tag": "rs-create-tag",
    "create-tag:compute": "rs-create-tag --compute",
    "create-tag:dry": "rs-create-tag --dry-run"
  }
}
```

## 🤖 CI/CD Usage (GitHub Actions)

> ℹ️ In CI/CD environments, always use `npx` when invoking `rs-*` commands.

This project is designed to be used in automated pipelines.

Typical flow:

1. Create a Release PR (compute version, changelog, build)
2. Review and merge the Release PR into `main`
3. Publish the release (tag, npm, GitHub Release)

Example workflows:
- create-release-pr.yml
- publish-on-merge.yml

## 🔁 Release Flow

This project follows a **two-step release strategy** designed for safety,
automation and reusability.

### 1️⃣ Prepare Release (Create Release PR)

Triggered when:

- A PR is merged into `main`

Actions:

- Computes next semantic version
- Updates `package.json`
- Generates `CHANGELOG.md`
- Builds the project (if applicable)
- Opens a **Release PR** (`release/v/x.y.z`)

### 2️⃣ Publish Release

Triggered when:

- A Release PR (`release/v/*`) is merged into `main`

Actions:

- Creates a Git tag
- Publishes to npm using **Trusted Publishing (OIDC)**
- Generates GitHub Release Notes
- Uploads build artifacts (`dist/**`)

    E --> G[GitHub Release]
```

✔️ Fully automated releases  
✔️ No npm tokens or secrets required (OIDC)  
✔️ No release loops  
✔️ Safe for concurrent merges  
✔️ Reusable in any project 

## 📦 Publishing to npm (Trusted Publishing)

This project uses **npm [Trusted Publishing](https://docs.npmjs.com/trusted-publishers) with GitHub Actions (OIDC)**.

- No npm tokens or secrets are required
- Publishing is handled entirely by GitHub Actions
- Triggered automatically when a Release PR is merged into `main`

## 🔍 Preview Mode

Generate preview files without touching your real changelog:

```bash
npm run preview
```

Remove previews:

```bash
npm run preview:clear
```

## 🛠 Development (Maintainers)

When working inside the `release-suite` repository itself, the CLI binaries
are **not available via npm or npx**, since they are not installed as a dependency.

In this case, run the scripts directly with Node.js:

```bash
node bin/compute-version.js
node bin/generate-changelog.js
node bin/generate-release-notes.js
node bin/preview.js create
node bin/create-tag.js
```

To test the CLI as a real consumer, you can use:

```bash
npm link
# or
npm install ../release-suite
```

## 🧩 Programmatic API

Each `bin/*.js` script now also exposes a programmatic API so you can call
the core logic directly from Node without spawning child processes. This
is useful for integration tests, tooling, or when you need to orchestrate
the actions from another script.

Examples:

```js
import { computeVersion } from 'release-suite/bin/compute-version.js';
import { generateChangelog } from 'release-suite/bin/generate-changelog.js';
import { generateReleaseNotes } from 'release-suite/bin/generate-release-notes.js';

const next = await computeVersion({ isPreview: true, cwd: process.cwd() });
await generateChangelog({ isPreview: true, cwd: process.cwd() });
await generateReleaseNotes({ isPreview: true, cwd: process.cwd() });
```

Notes:
- `cwd` controls the directory where git/package.json operations run (pass your consumer project's root).
- `isPreview: true` writes preview files (`CHANGELOG.preview.md`, `RELEASE_NOTES.preview.md`) and relaxes some external requirements (e.g., `gh`).
